# uDALES experiments

This repository is used as a template for setting up experiments in uDALES. By default, the uDALES experiments repository structure is as follows:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data        # Contains or links to any external data used by the experiments.
â”œâ”€â”€ docs        # Relevant documentation or papers used for the experiment.
â”œâ”€â”€ experiments # Configuration files grouped by experiment number.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 001     # Any configurations files needed by uDALES to run experiment 001.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 002     # Any configurations files needed by uDALES to run experiment 002.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ tools       # Additional or specialized tools other then the ones already included with uDALES.
â””â”€â”€ u-dales     # uDALES model repository.

```

Any files (excluding uDALES output files) in `experiments` and `tools` directories are automatically tracked by Git by default. Files in `data` and `docs` as these should be downloaded using a download script. If you require to change these settings please customize your `.gitignore`.




## Usage

To run a simulation in uDALES using this experiment template, compile uDALES as per installation instructions and run the case study from your experiment folder.

```sh
# E.g. to compile u-DALES using defaults
mkdir u-dales/build && cd u-dales/build
cmake ..
make -j4
cd ../..

# E.g. to run a sample experiment
cd experiments/001
mpiexec -np 2 ../../u-dales/build/u-dales namoptions.001
```
